# Tools to Learn for Ethical Hacking and Penetration Testing

To become an expert in ethical hacking and penetration testing, you need to master several core tools. These tools are essential for reconnaissance, vulnerability scanning, exploitation, password cracking, privilege escalation, post-exploitation, evasion, and web application security testing.

## 1. Reconnaissance and Information Gathering Tools

These tools help you gather information about your target system and network.

### Nmap (Network Mapper)
- **Purpose**: Network discovery, port scanning, OS detection.
- **Use**: Map out a target network by discovering open ports, services, and operating systems.
- **Common Commands**:
  - `nmap -sS [target]`: TCP SYN scan.
  - `nmap -sV [target]`: Service version detection.

### Recon-ng
- **Purpose**: Web-based reconnaissance framework.
- **Use**: Automate OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) collection, integrates with APIs like Shodan, Google, Bing, etc.
- **Common Use**: Collect subdomain information, domain records, employee info, etc.

### theHarvester
- **Purpose**: Information gathering from public sources (OSINT).
- **Use**: Discover emails, subdomains, and other information related to your target.
- **Common Use**: Discover email addresses and subdomains linked to a company.

### Shodan
- **Purpose**: Search engine for discovering Internet-connected devices.
- **Use**: Identify vulnerable IoT devices, servers, routers, and other devices exposed to the internet.
- **Common Use**: Search for exposed devices with specific vulnerabilities.

### Censys
- **Purpose**: Internet-wide scanning, similar to Shodan.
- **Use**: Discover exposed services and vulnerabilities in a targetâ€™s infrastructure.

## 2. Vulnerability Scanning and Exploitation Tools

After gathering information, you'll need tools to scan for vulnerabilities and exploit them.

### Burp Suite
- **Purpose**: Web application security testing.
- **Use**: Discover vulnerabilities like SQLi, XSS, CSRF, and Command Injection.
- **Practical Use**: Use the Proxy to intercept traffic, Scanner to find vulnerabilities, and Intruder to brute-force login attempts.

### Nikto
- **Purpose**: Web server scanner.
- **Use**: Scan web servers for known vulnerabilities, outdated software, and misconfigurations.
- **Practical Use**: Run `nikto -h http://target.com` to identify web server issues.

### Metasploit Framework
- **Purpose**: Exploit development and automated exploitation.
- **Use**: Launch exploits, perform post-exploitation tasks, and generate payloads.
- **Practical Use**: Use `msfconsole` to search for exploits and run them against vulnerable systems.

### OWASP ZAP (Zed Attack Proxy)
- **Purpose**: Web application security scanner and proxy.
- **Use**: Find insecure web apps through automated scans, intercept HTTP(S) traffic, and test for common web vulnerabilities.
- **Practical Use**: Automated and passive scanning during penetration tests.

### Dirb / Dirbuster
- **Purpose**: Directory and file brute-forcing tools.
- **Use**: Discover hidden directories or files on a web server using brute-force attacks.
- **Practical Use**: Use `dirb http://target.com/` to uncover files like `/admin/`, `/backup/`, etc.

## 3. Password Cracking and Credential Gathering Tools

Password cracking is a crucial part of most penetration tests.

### Hydra
- **Purpose**: Fast and flexible login brute-force tool.
- **Use**: Brute-force login forms, SSH, RDP, and HTTP authentication systems.
- **Practical Use**: Use `hydra -l admin -P /path/to/wordlist ssh://target.com` to crack SSH logins.

### John the Ripper
- **Purpose**: Password cracking tool.
- **Use**: Crack hashed passwords (MD5, SHA, etc.).
- **Practical Use**: Use `john --wordlist=passwords.txt hashes.txt` to break password hashes.

### Hashcat
- **Purpose**: Advanced password cracking tool.
- **Use**: Crack highly complex passwords (e.g., NTLM, WPA2).
- **Practical Use**: Use `hashcat -m 1000 -a 0 hashes.txt wordlist.txt` to perform rainbow table attacks.

### Mimikatz
- **Purpose**: Post-exploitation tool for Windows credential gathering.
- **Use**: Dump Windows password hashes, Kerberos tickets, and clear-text passwords from memory.
- **Practical Use**: After gaining access, use `mimikatz` to extract credentials from Windows machines.

## 4. Post-Exploitation and Privilege Escalation Tools

After exploitation, these tools help you escalate privileges and maintain access.

### PowerSploit
- **Purpose**: PowerShell-based exploitation and post-exploitation toolset.
- **Use**: Gain command execution, perform credential dumping, privilege escalation, etc.
- **Practical Use**: Use `Invoke-Mimikatz` to dump credentials from Windows machines.

### BloodHound
- **Purpose**: Active Directory attack and privilege escalation.
- **Use**: Map out Active Directory permissions and find attack paths for privilege escalation.
- **Practical Use**: Discover user relationships and permissions within an AD environment to escalate privileges.

### LinPEAS
- **Purpose**: Automated Linux privilege escalation script.
- **Use**: Find privilege escalation vectors on Linux systems.
- **Practical Use**: Scan for misconfigurations like SUID files, sudo permissions, and world-writable directories.

### Empire (PowerShell-based Post-Exploitation)
- **Purpose**: Post-exploitation framework for PowerShell and Python agents.
- **Use**: Control Windows and Linux machines post-exploitation.
- **Practical Use**: Use Empire for collaborative red teaming, attack simulation, and stealthy operations.

## 5. Evasion and Anti-Detection Tools

Evasion tools help you bypass detection by security systems.

### Veil Framework
- **Purpose**: Evasion framework to generate payloads that evade detection.
- **Use**: Create undetectable payloads for bypassing antivirus systems.
- **Practical Use**: Use `veil-evasion` to generate payloads designed to avoid detection.

### Cloakify
- **Purpose**: Obfuscation tool for payloads.
- **Use**: Obfuscate payloads to avoid detection by AV or IDS/IPS.
- **Practical Use**: Encrypt your payload with Cloakify before sending it to the target.

### Cobalt Strike
- **Purpose**: Full-featured post-exploitation and red teaming tool.
